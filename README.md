## ðŸ“Š EDA Highlights

Some key visualizations and analyses include:
- Correlation heatmaps
- Distribution plots (e.g., histograms, KDE)
- Pair plots between important features
- Boxplots to detect outliers
- Target variable imbalance checks

---

## ðŸ§¹ Preprocessing Steps

- Handling missing or null values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalization / Standardization
- Feature selection or dimensionality reduction (if any)
- Data splitting (Train/Test)

---

## ðŸ¤– Modeling Techniques

Implemented models:
- âœ… Logistic Regression
- âœ… K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- âœ… Decision Tree Classifier
- âœ… Random Forest Classifier
- âœ… Support Vector Machine (SVM)

> Optional: Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning (suggested for improvement)
