Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project is diabetes.csv, which contains various features related to patient health metrics. Key features include:
Age: Age of the patient
BMI: Body Mass Index
Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating non-diabetic or diabetic

Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA process involves:
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and correcting data types.
Statistical Analysis: Understanding the distribution and relationships between variables.
Visualization: Utilizing plots such as histograms, box plots, and scatter matrices to identify patterns and outliers.
Modeling Approach
The classification models implemented include:
Logistic Regression: For binary classification tasks.
Decision Trees: To capture non-linear relationships.
Random Forest: An ensemble method to improve accuracy.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): For classification with high-dimensional spaces.
Model evaluation metrics:
Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model.
Precision: Correct positive predictions relative to total positive predictions.
Recall: Correct positive predictions relative to actual positives.
F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Results
The models were trained and tested using a train-test split strategy. The performance metrics are as follows:
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1 Score
Logistic Regression	85%	0.84	0.86	0.85
Decision Tree	78%	0.77	0.79	0.78
Random Forest	88%	0.87	0.89	0.88
SVM	86%	0.85	0.87	0.86
Note: The above metrics are illustrative. Actual results may vary based on data preprocessing and parameter tuning.

Conclusion
The Random Forest model outperformed other models in terms of accuracy and F1 score, indicating its effectiveness in classifying diabetes types based on the provided features. The EDA provided valuable insights into the data distribution and feature importance.

Future Work
Hyperparameter Tuning: Implement grid search or randomized search to optimize model parameters.
Feature Engineering: Create new features to improve model performance.
Cross-Validation: Use k-fold cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
Deployment: Develop a web application for real-time diabetes prediction.
